The run_analysis.R script is designed to clean up some of the data contained in the file that can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

It assumes that the working directory contains the files:
* activity_labels.txt
* features.txt
* test/subject_test.txt
* test/X_test.txt
* test/y_test.txt
* train/subject_train.txt
* train/X_train.txt
* train/y_train.txt

It uses the package "reshape2"

The script performs the following:
+ reads the files:
	* test/subject_test.txt
	* test/X_test.txt
	* test/y_test.txt
	* train/subject_train.txt
	* train/X_train.txt
	* train/y_train.txt
+ Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. (the merged dataset is called dataMerge) adding the subject_id and the activity_id columns to the dataset
+ Reads the features.txt file
+ extracts only the features that contain the "mean" or "std" pattern using a pattern matching function
+ saves the features names and the index in separate vectors
+ Extracts from the dataset dataMerge only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. (the dataset where data of interest have been extracted is called dataSet.
+ Renames the columns in the data set using the descriptive features names. 
+ Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
+ writes the dataset dataSet to a file named "tidy_data_4.txt" 
+ Starting from the dataMerge dataset the script melts the data using the columns "subject_id", "activity_id" and "activity" as identifiers
+ Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (byactsubj)
+ writes the dataset byactsubj to a file named "tidy_data_5.txt"
